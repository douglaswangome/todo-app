# To-Do App
A to-do app always comes first in every React Js project website.\
So I decided to create one and make it as simple as it can be.\
Using react and its hooks(useState and useEffect) I was able to create a todo app where you can add tasks, change a task's status to completed and/or active.\
Using modals one is also able to edit and delete tasks.
